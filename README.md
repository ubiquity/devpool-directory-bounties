# Bounties for the DevPool Directory

This repository hosts bounties for the [devpool-directory repository](https://github.com/ubiquity/devpool-directory), herein referred to as the "Directory." The Directory aggregates all of the open bounties from the global DevPool network comprised of the [registered partners](https://github.com/ubiquity/devpool-directory/blob/development/projects.json). We can not store the bounties on the Directory itself because:
- We don't want to mix partners' bounties with Directory specific bounties.
- We disable github notifications for the Directory because it produces too many notifications.
