# Devpool Directory Bounties

This repository contains open bounties for the [devpool-directory](https://github.com/ubiquity/devpool-directory) repository while the [devpool-directory](https://github.com/ubiquity/devpool-directory) repository contains bounties from all of the [partners](https://github.com/ubiquity/devpool-directory/blob/development/projects.json).

We can't store [devpool-directory](https://github.com/ubiquity/devpool-directory) bounties in the devpool-directory's [issues section](https://github.com/ubiquity/devpool-directory/issues) because:
1. We don't want to mix partners' bounties with [devpool-directory](https://github.com/ubiquity/devpool-directory) specific bounties
2. We disable github notifications for the [devpool-directory](https://github.com/ubiquity/devpool-directory) repository because they spam an email client interface. So we prefer keeping [devpool-directory](https://github.com/ubiquity/devpool-directory) bounties in a separate repository (this one).
